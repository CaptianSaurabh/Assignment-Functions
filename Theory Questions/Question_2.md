Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python ?

Answer >> In Python, when defining a function, the variables in the parentheses are called parameters. They are placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it's called.

When calling a function, the values passed to the function are called arguments. They are the actual values that are assigned to the parameters.

Example > 

def greet(name, age):  # name and age are parameters
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet("John", 30)  # "John" and 30 are arguments

In this example, name and age are parameters, and "John" and 30 are arguments.
