What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used ?

Anawer >

In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined inline within a larger expression. It is a shorthand way to create a function without declaring a separate named function using the def keyword.

The syntax for a lambda function is:
lambda arguments: expression
Where arguments is a comma-separated list of variables that will be passed to the function, and expression is the code that will be executed when the function is called.

Here's an example of a simple lambda function:
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
Lambda functions are typically used in situations where a small, one-time-use function is needed. Here are some common use cases:

1. Sorting and filtering data: Lambda functions are often used as key functions for sorting or filtering data. 

For example:
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x**2)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

2. Event handling: Lambda functions can be used as event handlers in GUI programming or other situations where a small, one-time-use function is needed.
3. Data processing: Lambda functions can be used to perform simple data transformations or aggregations. 
For example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

4. Higher-order functions: Lambda functions can be used as arguments to higher-order functions, such as filter(), map(), or reduce().

5. One-time use: Lambda functions are useful when you need a function only once and don't want to declare a separate named function.

Remember, lambda functions are limited in their capabilities compared to regular functions. They can only contain a single expression, and they cannot include statements or complex logic. If you need a more complex function, it's usually better to define a regular function using the def keyword.
