What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function ? 

Answer >>
The return statement in a Python function is used to end the execution of the function call and send the function's result back to the caller. It determines the value that the function will output, and once the return statement is encountered, the function will stop executing and return the specified value.

Here's an example:

def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

print(add_numbers(5, 3))  # Output: 8


In this example, the add_numbers function takes two arguments, a and b, adds them together, and returns the result. The return statement is used to send the result back to the caller, which is then printed to the console.
