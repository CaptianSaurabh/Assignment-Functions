Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined ?

Answer > 
Generators in Python are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples. However, unlike lists, generators do not store all their values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values on-the-fly, one at a time, when you iterate over them. This makes them very memory-efficient, especially when working with large datasets.

A generator is defined using a generator function, which is a special type of function that uses the yield keyword instead of return. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over using a for loop or the next() function.

Here's an example of a simple generator function:
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = my_generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)  # prints 1, 2, 3


Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. my_generator() is called, returning a generator object gen.
2. The for loop calls next(gen), which executes the generator function until it reaches the first yield  statement.
3. The generator function yields the value 1 and pauses its execution.
4. The for loop receives the value 1 and prints it.
5. The for loop calls next(gen) again, which resumes the generator function from where it left off.
6. The generator function executes until it reaches the next yield statement, yielding the value 2.
7. Steps 4-6 repeat until the generator function reaches the end of its execution.
   
Generators are useful when:

You need to work with large datasets that don't fit in memory.
You want to generate values on-the-fly, without storing them all in memory.
You want to implement cooperative multitasking or asynchronous programming.
